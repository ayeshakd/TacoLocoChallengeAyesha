A backend service has been created in order to assist truck drivers and to help them manage customer addresses for their taco deliveries. The Delivery Service enables a truck driver to look up the entire deliveries database, add a new customerâ€™s name and address, update a delivery and delete a delivery. The database includes the delivery IDs, the customer names and the customer addresses. 

Primarily, the code has been written in Java and has been incorporated with JSON. Moreover, another programming language that has been extensively used is XML. Furthermore, the techniques mainly used in writing the code are: Jersey RESTful API and JAXB. JAXB has been used to convert Java objects to XML and vice versa. Similarly, Jersey uses MOXy to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa.
